## Student quick start

1. Install Flutter **3.47.7** — follow week 1's lab, or
   https://docs.flutter.dev/install. Confirm with
   `flutter --version`. If you use [fvm](https://fvm.app), the repo pins the
   version in `.fvmrc`; `fvm install` picks it up.
2. Clone this repository and run the week 1 starter:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/betsegawlemma/mobile-application-development-course.git
   cd mobile-application-development-course/weeks/week01-intro-dart/lab/starter
   flutter pub get              # no network: see lab 1, "Without internet"
   flutter run -d chrome        # or an emulator / device
   flutter test
   ```
3. Each week: read `weeks/weekNN-*/README.md` before class, open the slides,
   then do the lab from `weeks/weekNN-*/lab/README.md` starting in
   `lab/starter/`. Each week's material appears just before its lecture,
   its starter before the lab, and its `lab/solution/` after the lab week. The complete example app
   (`capstone/`) appears after week 14.
